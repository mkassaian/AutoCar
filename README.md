# AutoCar
A 3-D printed, autonomous, web-controllable car

This project was made with Emile Givental as part of an AP Computer Science course. The car chassis is 3-D printed, and houses a Raspberry Pi 3 which runs server.py, a script which creates a local web server and runs the logic for controlling the two wheels and reading info from the front, left, and right ultrasonic distance sensors. The wheels are powered by a 9-volt battery, whereas the Pi is powered by a bottom-mounted portable battery pack. The connections from the Pi, sensors, and wheels are all soldered onto a custom-machined PCB.
